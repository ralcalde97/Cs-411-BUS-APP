Idea #1: What's the quickest way to get home?

A simple, but useful app that combines data from various transportation services to determine what the quickest route home is for the user.

Third-party authentication:
Login with Facebook or Twitter so that the app can store your favorite places (such as home, work, class, etc.) and notify you when you need to leave!

Database:
Stores favorite locations and user preferences in a database.

Two publicly available APIs:
1. Boston University Shuttle location API
2. MBTA location API for trains and buses




Idea #2: Bitcoin Wallet
