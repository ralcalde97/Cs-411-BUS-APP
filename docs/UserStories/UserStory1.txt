User Story 1

As a new user, I want to be able to login with twitter and save my favorite stations,
so that I can have this data saved whenever I need to use the app.

The new user must have a social media account in order to login to the application. Once 
the account is verified by the application, the users are then given the option to save the stations close
to their favorite locations such as home, school, work, etc. 
So that they can be notified of when is the best time to leave and what mean of transportation to usein order to get where they are going on time. If the user does not complete all the steps of creating a new account before exiting the application,
the data will be lost and they will have to start over.
