User Story 1

As a new user, I want to be able to login with Facebook/Google and save my usual locations,
so that I can have this data saved whenever I need to use the app.

The new user must have a social media account in order to login to the application. Once 
the account is verified by the application, the user is then given the option to save 
locations such as home, school, work, etc. and sync their Google calendar (see user story 3)
so that they can be notified of when is the best time to leave in order to get where they
are going on time. The user can also choose whether or not to receive notifications. If the
user does not complete all the steps of creating a new account before exiting the application,
the data will be lost and they will have to start over.
