User Story 4

As a phone user, I would like the webapp to be mobile-friendly
so that I can use it on the go.

This app is meant to be used to get from here to there, so the most 
common use will most likely be on a mobile device (especially if uber 
is being implemented). Therefore, the webapp needs to load and run 
well on a mobile device as well as on a regular computer. Certain 
functionalities like sign-in, switching views, and updating forms need 
to be well managed on a differently sized screen. This should also work 
no matter the device (iPhone or Android etc).
