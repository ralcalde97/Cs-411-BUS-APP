User Story 2

As a BU student I want to view transit times from all modes of transportation
to determine the quickest way to get home.

When a user is logged into the application (see user story 1) they should be 
able to see a quick view of MBTA times, BU Bus times, and Uber times as well. 
In this way, they will have a quick snapshot of what their current fastest 
option home is. If everything goes right, the user will be able to click on 
which option they would like to use to get home and receive a more detailed 
description about how to proceed on this route. In the case of a lost internet 
connection, the application would display a connection error message to the user.
