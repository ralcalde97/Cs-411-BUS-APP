User Story 3

As a BU student, I want to sync my Google calendar into 
the app so that I can find routes to my meetings and classes.

This data should be saved in a database, but if location is not 
added to each event, the app must request this information from 
the user. The user should be able to disable notifications and 
also specify how far in advance they desire to be notified of the 
shortest route, and which means of transportation to use.
